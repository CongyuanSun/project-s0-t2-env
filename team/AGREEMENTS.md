# 4/30/2020
   
Team decided to make repo public (open source under MIT license).

# Agreements

1. When one of us is absent for an unavoidable reason, we will let the other team members know on the team slack channel, in advance when possible, as soon as possible afterwards when not.
2. We will each try to keep such absences to a minimum.
3. Those of us that are present will do our best to share with the absent team member(s) what they missed and help them get back up to speed.
4. We will all do our best to contribute to the teams success.
5. When possible, team should try to come to a consensus (ideally use compromise). If that is impossible, we can use a majority vote.
6. If someone asks a question on the Slack, a team member should reply within 24 hours (sooner if possible).
7. Everyone should always have at least one story assigned to them, and should be making progress on their story each week.
8. Team atmosphere should be positive and supportive. It's okay to disagree, but always be kind and respectful to team mates.
