# Our current knowledge
* Most of us are new to REACT and Next JS
* Darragh has some experience with it

# What we plan on doing 
* We will all go through the tutorial on Next.js 
* We will all go through a basic demo on databases 
* We will all look into how to use API's
* Noah, Darragh, and Stuart will look more into the data that we will be using and how to get that data into a database throughout Week 3
* Katelyn, Zachary, and Sara will look into more into Next JS and html/CCS throughout Week 3 
* Once we get solid API's we can split into pairs per API throughout Week 4
