* the city vs city game we mentioned yesterday
* social media like we discussed yesterday
* You can track your personal emissions compared to that of the city and see if you are contributing more than average (we can just say the average is the total emissions we track divided by city population roughly) and then set personal goals for yourself
* Perhaps incorporate ecological heath into our environmental impact calculation (insecticide/pesticide usage, invasive species, phenological health, deforestation, etc) 
* Impact of solar panels (and impact if more people got solar panels)
* Impact of coronavirus lockdown on CO2 emissions by city/county/state/country (cars, industrial, etc.)
* Minimized loads of garbage going to landfills due to coronavirus lockdown?
